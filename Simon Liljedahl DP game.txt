A game where you pick up a maskros and put it in your inventory. but watch out!! so you dont start spinning to oblivion. 
There is an amazing back story to this game. that hasnt yet been fully described. But let me tell you this.
The protagonist has traveled 10000000000000 km by foot in search for love and revenge. because a certain guy has been really uncool to
the main character which really sets the feeling and spiritual connection between the player and the main character. 
In context to this. Right now the character is located right before a secret meeting thats been scheduled at this exact location
A haunting but yet so facinating surprise awaits the main character. 
to be continued.

Patterns:
- Singleton, in `InventoryManager.cs` in `class InventoryManager` as `InventoryManager.instance`
  Used singleton to make the single instance of the class that could be accessed from anywhere.
- Composite, in general the distrubiution of the code betweeen all scripts. There is a player mananger that manages 
various types of functions.
- Observer pattern, Subscribers in`PlayerManager.cs` in class `PlayerManager`in Function void Start() as "script".OnItemTouch
  Action in physicsComponent in class  PhysicsComponent at line 11 and 24
